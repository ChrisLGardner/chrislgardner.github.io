This blog will likely end up full of various problems I've fixed with PowerShell and at least some of the scripts I've used to do that. It's mostly aimed at being a log to help me remember what I did if I encounter a problem again and can't find the script but hopefully it helps others if they find it.

I'll likely also document some of the sessions I've attended at various user groups and any sessions I've given myself. So far that's only some of the London PowerShell user group but will be expanding over the next few months.
